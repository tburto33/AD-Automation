## AD-Automation: Collab QA Automation Testing Project

## About:
This was a collaboration with a friend for me to learn Java and automation using Selenium Webdriver for basic QA testing. During which I learned:

1) Setting up webdriver and environment for Selenium.
2) Using relative/absolute xpaths to navigate webpages. 
3) Using assertions for testing.
4) Logging results to console.

*(This is mainly a learning and portfolio piece.)*

**Languages**: Java
**Frameworks**: Selenium Webdriver and TestNG
